    # not yet support this, see: https://github.com/unionai-oss/pandera/issues/421.
    # The "ideal" workaround I think involves overriding `__get_pydantic_json_schema__`,
    # as worked for `JsonSerializableDataFrameModel` above, however the meaningful data
    # we would want to access within that classmethod is the subscripted `DataframeSchema`
    # type passed by the user. This *is* accessible outside classmethods (in the context
    # in which the subscription happens) with `typing.get_args`. However, that does not work
    # on the `cls` object we have in the classmethod. It *feels* like this SO post somehow
    # points towards a solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/65064882, but I really struggled
    # to make it work. So in the interim, we will just always use the generic schema declared
    # below, which will not contain any schema-specific information. This *will not* affect
    # validation behavior, only JSON Schema generation.
