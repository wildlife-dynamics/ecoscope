Ecoscope GUI
============

The Ecoscope GUI provides a cross-platform, easy-to-use graphical user interface to be able to filter events and subject group observations from your EarthRanger instance, and process them with Ecoscope.

The downloaded data can then be exported as either a geopackage (``.gpkg``) or a CSV (``.csv``) file.
