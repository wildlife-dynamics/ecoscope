Ecoscope
========

The Ecoscope core python library is built for analyses related to wildlife movement, environmental and conservation datasets. It provides methods and approaches for: Data I/O (EarthRanger, Google Earth Engine, Landscape Dynamics, MoveBank, Geopandas), Movement Data (Relocations, Trajectories, Home-Ranges, EcoGraph, Recurse, Resampling, Filtering), Visualization, Environmental analyses (Seasons determination, Remote sensing anomalies), Covariate labeling (Day/Night, Seasonal, GEE Image Collections/Images).

Development & Testing
=====================
Development dependencies are included in `environment.yml`.

Please configure code-quality git hooks with:

.. code:: console

    >>> pre-commit install
