Ecoscope GUI
----

## Features

The Ecoscope GUI (graphical user interface) is an easy-to-use cross-platform software that allows you to:

- choose events or subject group observations from your EarthRanger instance, optionally filtered by date ranges
- download the data
- export the resulting data as either a geopackage (`.gpkg`) or a CSV (`.csv`) file and save it to your machine.

The GUI supports 3 user interface languages at the moment:

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish

Screenshots can be found at [the bottom of the page](#Screenshots).

The GUI uses `ecoscope` under the hood to filter, clean, and process the downloaded data. The interface is built with
Python and the Qt graphical framework.

## Downloads

**We are actively working on open-sourcing the GUI code but until then downloads are hosted on the EarthRanger team's
Google Drive (links below).** Once the code has been open-sourced, releases will be provided via GitHub. More details
will
be provided on this page when that happens.

:::{note}
We do not collect any usage or other data about your use of the software. In addition, to ensure the safety of your
EarthRanger account, your login credentials are never saved to disk in plaintext. Instead, we will ask you to re-enter
your password
to confirm your identity every time you open the software.

:::{tip}
For security-conscious users, as long as we host the files on Google Drive, we will provide the SHA-256 download
checksums below, so you can verify the integrity of the files you download.

:::{attention}
Step 3 above is mandatory. If you skip it, you will not be able to open the program by
double-clicking `Ecoscope GUI.app`. Instead, you will see the following error dialog that
says `"Ecoscope GUI.app" is damaged and can't be opened.`

   ```{figure-md}
   ![GUI Interface](_static/images/gui_interface_damaged_error.png){.bg-primary .mb-1 width=100px}

   '"Ecoscope GUI.app" is damaged and can't be opened' error.
   ```

If you see this error, do Step 3 and try double-clicking on `Ecoscope GUI.app` again. You do not need to re-download the
app.

:::{note}
We're working on improving this so that you don't have to do step 3.
